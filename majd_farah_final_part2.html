    <h1>Reflection Questions</h1>
    <!-------------------------------------------------------->
    <h2>What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/JavaScript?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Before this class, I had a basic understanding of HTML and CSS. I could create simple pages and add some styling, but JavaScript was a whole different story. I’d heard of concepts like DOM manipulation and event handling, but I had no clue how they worked or how to implement them in practice.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Did you use a template or did you build your portfolio from scratch and why?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I decided to use a template for my portfolio because it gave me a good foundation to work with. This allowed me to focus on adding functionality and refining the CSS without spending too much time designing the layout from scratch. I still had to customize the styling and make it look cohesive, so it wasn’t just a matter of copying and pasting content into the template.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What was your most challenging part of your portfolio (ie, the template, artifacts, CSS, etc.)?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The most challenging part was definitely getting the JavaScript form validation to work smoothly. Dynamically displaying error messages and ensuring everything updated correctly took a lot of trial and error. I also struggled with Regex for a while. It also wasn’t just about getting the validation to work, but also making sure it looked good and was user-friendly, which made it even harder.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How did this class change your view on Web Development?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>This class taught me that web development isn’t just about making things look good—it’s about user experience too. Learning how to manipulate the DOM and debug JavaScript gave me a greater understanding of how complex some features are in modern websites. It also showed me how creative and rewarding web development can be.</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>What would you recommend to future students taking this class?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Start your assignments early, especially the ones involving JavaScript, because they might take longer than you expect. Using tools like the browser developer tools and console to catch errors and debug your code is a great help. Google is also your best friend—everything you need is already documented and readily available online.</li>
    </ul>
